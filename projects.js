      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Distance learners often struggle with motivation and self-regulation. This project aimed to design a learning dashboard that incorporates Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) principles to support and motivate students.</p>
      
      <h3>My Approach & Role</h3>
      <p>As the sole UI/UX designer, I led the project through a full User-Centered Design (UCD) process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research:</strong> Conducted interviews with 5 students to understand their pain points with online learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> Sketched user flows and wireframes to map out the core features like goal setting, progress tracking, and resource management.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Developed a high-fidelity, interactive prototype in Figma.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Ran usability testing sessions with 5 participants to gather feedback and iterate on the design.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Outcome</h3>
      <p>The final design achieved an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of <strong>82/100</strong>, indicating an "Excellent" level of user acceptance. The dashboard was praised for its intuitive layout and features that promoted proactive learning habits.</p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>The main company website was experiencing low user engagement and a high bounce rate, indicating a frustrating user experience. Simultaneously, a key client, CV. Harapan Baru, needed a new website application designed from the ground up to better serve their customers. The core challenge was to identify the root causes of these usability issues through research and deliver data-driven redesigns that would significantly improve performance for both entities.</p>
      
      <h3>My Approach & Role</h3>
      <p>As the UI/UX Designer Intern, I took a lead role in the end-to-end design process. My approach was centered on a comprehensive, user-focused methodology:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Led User Research: I initiated and led foundational user research, conducting over 5 in-depth interviews and analyzing more than 20 survey responses to uncover key user pain points and needs.</li>
        <li>Ideation & Prototyping: Based on the research insights, I developed an extensive range of solutions, creating over 30 wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes to visualize the new user journeys.</li>
        <li>Validation & Iteration: I conducted usability testing with 10 users, gathering critical feedback to refine the designs and ensure the final product was both intuitive and efficient.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Outcome</h3>
      <p>The data-driven design process led to measurable improvements and successful outcomes across the board<div class="modal__links">
      <ul>
        <li>The designed main website for <strong> PT. Jago Talenta Indonesia </strong> resulted in a projected <strong> 25% increase in user engagement </strong> and a <strong> 15% reduction in bounce rate. </strong></li>
        <li>Usability testing confirmed a <strong> 40% improvement in task efficiency </strong> for users navigating the new site.</li>
